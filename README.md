### lift & chow. ooga booga

A workout app built for people who are sick of hitting paywalls.

A modern, user-focused database for exercises, workout routines, weight/progress tracking and training plans.

Built with React.js using Pocketbase for backend

### getting started

Start the app by cloning the repository. Then `cd pb` and run `./pocketbase serve`.
In another terminal, `cd pb_app` and run `npm run dev` to get started.

### learning experience

For this project, I relied mainly on Tailwind CSS for styling, React Router for navigation, and Recharts to create visualizations.

In this project, I used the following techniques taught in class:

- UseContext (to handle Authentication state)
- Nested Routes to create a fast, modern-feeling dashboard
- UseState, UseEffect, and Custom React Hooks for login, logout, and data storage
- Functional Components (and lots of em)
- Vite for bundling and faster development experience

Although I cannot honestly say that the app is finished (I wanted to add the ability to track my meals), I am quite pleased with the outcome so far. I believe I have met the requirements, especially since our class is primarly front-end focused. The areas I have yet to complete are mostly back-end related and ended up being trickier than expected due to my unusual choice of backend - Pocketbase.

Unfortuantely, the service is not super well-documented and will take a bit more time to fully understand, so I can complete the last few components of my application.

### roadmap

**_Next Steps_**

- add weight daily
- visualize weight gain/loss
- pull workouts from database
- get workout info

**_Sprint 2_**

- Visualize exercise progress
- Add BMI calculations & make sign up more personalized
- Make radial progress bars for overview page (see if workout, calories, and weight has been completed)
